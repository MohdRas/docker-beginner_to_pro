# Prerequisite
- Linux fundamentals - Basic Linux commands

# History & Motivation
- Docker helps to make local env as close as to production env where we are gonna deploy our application.
- setting up development env is easy. Just one command "docker compose up"
- earlier we need "deploment binary", "dependencies", "configurations" to deploy an application. But with containers, just run this container image with these options.
